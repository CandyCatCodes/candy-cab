hello Marco. I had the same problem and did this to solve it...

First you'll notice in the tutorial, it is v2 of the NativeWind docs
 being used while current version of the docs is v4. 
 Be sure to follow the v4 docs during your setup.
Follow either Getting Started > React Native  or Expo Router and..

1. Install NativeWind dependencies
2. Setup tailwind.config.js
3. Create that global.css file
4. Add your babel.config.js AND metro.config.js as in the docs
5. Import your global.css file into app/_layout.js

Just follow those steps as in the docs, stop and restart your server 
and all should be good, ready to proceed with the tutorial.
Good luck

 @stephenaraka5870  hi! i've been having this same issue and followed the docs.
  i created the global file but when i import it, after trying to run it
   on expo go, i get this error "Unable to resolve "./././global.css" 
   from "app\_layout.tsx". the path is correct though.. if i don't import it,
    the server runs on expo go but the screen is black, not the white background
     with the text he added. any ideas on how i could fix this?? thank you!
